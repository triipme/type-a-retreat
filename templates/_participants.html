								<h2 class="name">David Mendelson</h2>
								<h4 class="role">CEO at Jingzhu Garments Co Ltd<br/> Investor/VC</h4>
								<p class="desc">
									David set up his first import/export company at the age of 20 in Sydney, Australia. Later traveling frequently to China, he sought after new opportunities, seeing the trends evolving in China for trading textiles &amp; accessories. During those years he witnessed an unprecedented change in his clients buyer patterns, and decided to sell out of his trading company and join Jingzhu Garment Co Ltd manufacturer (a previous supplier). He soon realised providing a bridge for western clients to buy directly with Jingzhu Garments Co Ltd factory, clients would achieve quicker communication and direct factory prices. At present, David is actively investing in startups with niche industries and unique points of difference. Already a handful of companies, he is not one to be afraid of backing the outsiders and believing in the inventor, whilst helping in areas of international contacts, whatever that may be.
